## Project Overview


1️⃣ [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/5WH9iB9n/labspt7-quake)

1️⃣ [Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/User-Research-8cd64de109404266b2537457a426738d)

There are several routes to get out information about earthquakes:

/lastQuake/[source]/[magnitude]

Where source is either USGS or EMSC, depending on which data source you would like to draw information from. In a future release this will be updated to include an option for both sources once we merge them.

Magnitude is a number from 0-11 representing the minimum magnitude of earthquakes that you would like to see returned.


/last/[time]/[source]/[magnitude]

For this time is one of 'hour', 'day', 'week', or 'month'. These time frames were selected to match the USGS API, in a future release this may be updated to be more flexible.

Source and Magnitude are the same as before.
